## Dashoboard for Angular - How to switch themes / color schemes in Angular application

Our HTML JS Dashboard does not provide a way to switch themes in Angular applications using the same mechanism as in our [online demo](https://demos.devexpress.com/Dashboard/). In the case of an Angular application, it is necessary to implement this mechanism manually. This example demonstrates a way to implement the required functionality.

For more information about the implementation, please refer to our [HTML JS Dashboard - How to switch themes/color schemes in Angular applications](https://www.devexpress.com/Support/Center/Question/Details/T741077/html-js-dashboard-how-to-switch-themes-color-schemes-in-angular-applications) KB article.

## Quick Start

In the **asp-net-core-dashboard-backend** folder run the following command:

```
dotnet run
```

In the **dashboard-angular-app** folder, run the following commands:

```
npm i
ng serve --open
```
